# OFList

Create a daily to-do list for OmniFocus:

![List](./Extras/List.png)

Output is a markdown (.md) file which can be easily converted to a PDF.

Adapted from [Jason Verly's OmniFocus*_*Due*_*List.scpt](http://mygeekdaddy.net/2015/07/03/getting-my-daily-to-do-list-out-of-omnifocus/) to access the flagged tasks instead of by due date.
 
For easy access the toolbar within OmniFocus the script file can be added to the script folder (Help > Open Script Folder). To add to toolbar right-click and select "Customize Toolbar" then script should show up and available to drag to the toolbar.

![Toolbar](./Extras/Toolbar.png)

The image above shows the icon for OFList on the toolbar, allowing for easy access.

Hope that you can find a use for it!
